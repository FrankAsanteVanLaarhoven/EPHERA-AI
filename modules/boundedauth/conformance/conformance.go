// Package conformance checks that a host's [boundedauth.Store] actually spends
// a credential exactly once, atomically with the effect it authorises.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// The interesting requirement in bounded authority is not the cryptography. The
// signature checking is a hundred lines and either works or fails obviously.
// The requirement that gets shipped broken is atomicity: that spending the
// credential and doing the work commit together.
//
// A broken implementation passes normal testing. It passes code review, because
// the code reads correctly — look up, check, mark, act. It fails under
// concurrency and under partial failure, which is to say it fails in
// production, on the paths where money is involved, in ways that surface as a
// customer charged twice or an authorisation that could be replayed.
//
// So this suite tries specifically to break those. It runs the failure modes
// that do not occur in a quiet test environment: simultaneous presentation of
// the same credential, and an effect that fails after the credential has
// notionally been spent.
//
// # Using it
//

// Simply starting N goroutines is not enough, and this check originally did

// scheduler serialised the attempts often enough that the double spend went
// undetected in roughly one run in five. A check that catches a defect four
// times out of five lets a broken store pass by luck, which is worse than not
// having the check — it produces a conformance result nobody should rely on.
//
// So the effect holds a barrier: each attempt that reaches it waits until every
// attempt has, or until a short timeout. A store that spends the credential
// before running the effect admits exactly one goroutine, which waits out the
// timeout alone and proceeds — costing one timeout per run and nothing else. A
