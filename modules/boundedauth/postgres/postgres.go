// Package postgres is a reference [boundedauth.Store] on PostgreSQL.
//
// It is a separate Go module from the core deliberately. A verifier embedded in
// someone else's service should not inherit a database driver because this
// repository happens to ship one, and the core's zero-dependency property is
// worth more than the convenience of a single module.
//
// # How the guarantee is obtained
//
// Everything rests on one transaction:
//
//	BEGIN
//	  INSERT INTO boundedauth_consumptions (jti, ...)   -- primary key
//	  <the effect runs here, on this transaction>
//	COMMIT
//
// Single use comes from the primary key rather than from a read. There is no
// SELECT to check whether the credential was spent, because a check followed by
// an insert is two operations with a gap between them, and the gap is the
// double spend. The insert either succeeds or raises a unique violation, and
// PostgreSQL resolves the race internally: a second inserter blocks on the
// first one's uncommitted row and then, when it commits, sees the violation.
//
// Atomicity comes from the effect running on the same transaction. The host
// gets it with [Tx], and if the host ignores that and opens its own connection,
// the conformance suite fails — correctly, because the guarantee would be
// absent however the code reads.
//
// Rollback needs no special handling and that is the point of the arrangement:
// if the effect returns an error, the transaction is rolled back, and the
// consumption row goes with it. The credential is spendable again because it
// was never durably spent, so a customer whose payment failed is not asked to
// authorise it a second time.
