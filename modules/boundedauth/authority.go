// Package boundedauth implements bounded authority for money movement: a
// signed, transaction-bound, single-use credential, and a receipt bound to the
// effect it authorised.
//
// # The problem this solves
//
// The usual way to authorise a payment is a token: the caller presents a string,
// the server checks that it is valid, and the payment proceeds. The token says
// who the caller is. It does not say what they agreed to. Anything holding a
// valid token can move any amount to any recipient within its scope, as often as
// it likes, and nothing in the credential itself contradicts that.
//
// That was tolerable when the caller was a person clicking a button. It is not
// tolerable when the caller is an automated agent composing payment requests
// from text it was given, because the interesting question stops being "is this
// caller authenticated" and becomes "did a human agree to THIS payment".
//
// A bounded authority answers the second question. It is a signature over the
// exact transaction — payer, payee, amount, fee, currency, transfer — so a
// credential obtained for one payment cannot be presented for another. It is
// spent once, atomically with the money it authorises. And it produces a receipt
// bound to the same digest, so the proof of what was authorised and the proof of
// what happened are the same chain of evidence.
//
// The consequence worth stating plainly: a compromised backend, a
// prompt-injected agent, or a hostile intermediary cannot obtain authority for a
// payment the human did not see. The worst any of them achieves is the payment
// that was actually signed.
//
// # What this package does not do
//
// It does not authenticate anyone. It verifies a credential minted by an issuer
// you trust. Producing that credential — WebAuthn, HSM, whatever binds a human
// to a key — is the issuer's job, and this package is deliberately indifferent
// to it beyond recording which method was used.
//
// It does not store anything. Single use requires durable state and, more
// importantly, requires that state to commit in the same transaction as the
// effect. Only the host knows how to do that, so the host implements [Store] and
// this package supplies a conformance suite that checks they got it right.
//
// # Wire format
//
//	base64url(payload JSON) "." base64url(ed25519 signature)
//
// The signature covers the encoded payload bytes exactly as transmitted, so
// verification never re-serialises and there is no canonicalisation ambiguity.
