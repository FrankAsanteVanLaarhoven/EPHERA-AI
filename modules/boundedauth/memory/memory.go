// Package memory is a reference [boundedauth.Store] that keeps everything in
// process memory.
//
// It exists for two reasons, and neither of them is production use.
//
// First, it is the executable definition of the contract. The conformance suite
// is a set of assertions; this is something that satisfies them, so an
// implementer has a worked example of what "atomically with the effect" means
// rather than only a description of it.
//
// Second, it demonstrates that the contract is satisfiable without a database.
// The property under test is transactional, not relational: stage the effect's
// writes, apply them only when the effect returns successfully, discard them
// otherwise, and hold the credential's identity against concurrent attempts for
// that whole span.
//
// It is not durable, so it does not survive a restart, and everything in it is
// lost. Use a real database for anything that matters.
